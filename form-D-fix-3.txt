Dato’ CEO, excellent — your latest OCR extraction and parsed object are **very close to perfect**. Let me verify everything once more and tell you **exactly what still needs fixing** and **what you’ve successfully solved**.

Below is your updated extraction + parsed object:

***

# ✅ Verification Report (Final Pass)

## ✔️ 1. OCR Improvements (Very Good)

Your OCR has significantly improved:

*   **Branch address is now perfect**
*   **Principal address normalized**
*   **Issue date correctly restored to 2017‑03‑02**
*   **Signing officer correctly extracted**
*   **Noise removed from most lines**
*   **Confidence increased to 0.9029**

You’ve clearly implemented the preprocessing + PSM segmentation correctly.

***

# ❌ Remaining Issues (Only 3 Left)

There are **three** detection issues still to fix — these are **parsing rules**, not OCR quality.

***

## ❌ 1. `documentTitle` still empty

You should extract:

    CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION  
    THE REGISTRATION OF BUSINESSES ACT 1956 (ACT 197)

### 🔧 **Fix (regex rule)**

Look for the block between:

*   `FORM D (RULE 13)`  
    and
*   `This is to certify`

Regex example:

```regex
FORM D.*?\n(.*?)\n(.*?)\nThis is to certify
```

Then combine them into:

```json
"documentTitle": "CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION; THE REGISTRATION OF BUSINESSES ACT 1956 (ACT 197)"
```

***

## ❌ 2. `legalBasis` is still empty

Extract the Act details:

    THE REGISTRATION OF BUSINESSES ACT 1956 (ACT 197)

### 🔧 **Fix**

Regex to capture Act name + Act number:

```regex
REGISTRATION OF BUSINESSES ACT\s+1956\s*\(ACT\s*197\)
```

Structured output:

```json
"legalBasis": {
  "actName": "Registration of Businesses Act 1956",
  "actNumber": "Act 197"
}
```

***

## ❌ 3. `branchAddresses` still contains `&amp;`

Your OCR text is correct:  
`15 & 17, JALAN CYBER 16 …`

But parsed output still shows:

    15 &amp; 17, ...

This means your parser is **HTML-encoding** text after OCR.

### 🔧 **Fix**

Run HTML unescape:

```python
import html
clean_text = html.unescape(raw_text)
```

Or before saving parsed JSON:

```python
branch = branch.replace("&amp;", "&")
```

***

# 🎉 Everything Else is Correct

Here are the fields that are now confirmed 100% accurate:

| Field                          | Status |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| docType                        | ✔️     |
| companyName                    | ✔️     |
| registrationNumber             | ✔️     |
| oldRegistrationNumber          | ✔️     |
| registrationDate               | ✔️     |
| validUntil                     | ✔️     |
| registeredAddress              | ✔️     |
| branchAddresses (text correct) | ✔️     |
| issuePlace                     | ✔️     |
| issueDate                      | ✔️     |
| signingOfficer                 | ✔️     |
| confidence                     | ✔️     |

You're down to **formatting/business rules only**, not OCR problems.

# 📌 Final Recommendations for Your Detection Pipeline

Apply these **3 parsing rule upgrades**:

### **1. Extract documentTitle using block-based extraction**

Between:

    FORM D
    ↓
    This is to certify

### **2. Populate legalBasis using Act regex**

Very consistent across all Form D certificates.

### **3. Apply HTML decode to remove &**

This is from your own pipeline, not OCR.
