Great—thanks for sharing both the **Raw Text Extraction** and your **Parsed Data Object**, Dato’ CEO.  
I validated each field against the image you provided and suggested a couple of light normalizations so the output is production‑ready for KYC.

***

## ✅ What’s correct (good to keep)

*   **companyName** → `ANALOG DATA SDN BHD` ✅
*   **registrationNumber (new 12‑digit)** → `190933432134` ✅
*   **oldRegistrationNumber (ROC)** → `1234567-H` ✅
*   **type** → `Sdn. Bhd. (Private Limited)` ✅ (correct for Form 9)
*   **issuePlace** → `KL` ✅
*   **issueDate** & **registrationDate** → `2007-06-07` ✅
*   **signingOfficer** → `DATUK NOR AZIMAH ABDUL AZIZ` ✅ (your raw text already has the correct full name—nice!)

Fields that are **expected to be empty** on standard Form 9 (so your empty values are correct):

*   **validUntil** → `""`
*   **registeredAddress** → `""`
*   **branchAddresses** → `[]`

> Form 9 typically doesn’t print the registered office address or any validity period—the certificate is a record of incorporation, not a license with expiry.

## ⚠️ Minor OCR artifacts (for awareness only)

*   Ordinal lost: raw shows **“7 day”** instead of **“7th day”** (common with superscripts).
*   Footer/header noise (logos, watermark, QR area) introduces typos like “vorlly”, “Thess”, etc.—these are irrelevant to your parsed fields and can be ignored.

No corrections are necessary to your final fields because you already normalized the dates and names properly.

## ✨ Recommended normalized JSON (drop‑in)

If you want a slightly richer, structured object for downstream systems while preserving your keys, here’s a cleaned version that includes a **document header** and **legal references**, but keeps your core schema intact:

```json
{
  "docType": "FORM_9",
  "documentTitle": "Certificate of Incorporation of Private Company",
  "legalBasis": {
    "primaryAct": "Companies Act 2016 (Act 777)",
    "incorporationReference": "Companies Act 1965"
  },
  "companyName": "ANALOG DATA SDN BHD",
  "type": "Sdn. Bhd. (Private Limited)",
  "registrationNumber": "190933432134",
  "oldRegistrationNumber": "1234567-H",
  "registrationDate": "2007-06-07",
  "validUntil": "",
  "registeredAddress": "",
  "branchAddresses": [],
  "issuePlace": "KL",
  "issueDate": "2007-06-07",
  "signingOfficer": "DATUK NOR AZIMAH ABDUL AZIZ",
  "qrPayload": "",
  "confidence": 0.8726,
  "sourceFile": "sample-cert-form-9-SDN-BHD.jpg",
  "notes": [
    "Ordinals normalized (7th).",
    "Registered address and validity are typically not present on Form 9."
  ]
}
```

## 🔧 (Optional) Small hardening tips you can apply in code

1.  **Ordinal normalization**  
    If a date line matches `Dated at <place> this <d> day of <Month> <YYYY>`, force the `d → dth` form for readability in any human‑facing output (you already store ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`, which is perfect for systems).

2.  **Issue place canonicalization**  
    Map common OCR confusions (`KE`, `K1`, `K|`) to `KL` only when preceded by `Dated at` and followed by `this`—keeps corrections precise.

3.  **Officer line extraction**  
    Always take the **line above** the one containing `REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES` as the officer’s name, then trim & title‑case; it’s the most stable heuristic across Form 9 scans.

4.  **QR payload**  
    If you want to capture QR values when available, add a pyzbar decode step. Keep it optional—many scans will not decode perfectly due to compression or watermark overlays.

## ✅ Bottom line

Your **Parsed Data Object** is already **accurate and production‑ready** for this image.  
If you’d like, I can fold these normalizations and heuristics into your extractor so every Form 9 you process lands in this clean, consistent shape. Want me to push a patched `extract_form_9` and endpoint response that emits the normalized JSON above?
