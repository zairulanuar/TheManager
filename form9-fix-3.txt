Dato’ CEO, I’ve reviewed your **Raw OCR Text**, **Parsed Data Object**, and the **actual Form 9 certificate image**, and here is a **precise verification** of what is correct, what is wrong, and what must be fixed in your detection/parsing logic.

This is similar to your Form D extraction progress — your OCR quality is improving, but your **parsing rules** still need refinement.

***

# ✅ **1. What the Parsed Data Object Got Correct**

The following fields are **correct** and match the certificate:

| Field                                 | Status | Remarks                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **docType**                           | ✔️     | Correct: FORM 9 = Certificate of Incorporation    |
| **documentTitle**                     | ✔️     | Extracted accurately                              |
| **legalBasis.primaryAct**             | ✔️     | “Companies Act 2016 (Act 777)”                    |
| **legalBasis.incorporationReference** | ✔️     | “Companies Act 1965”                              |
| **companyName**                       | ✔️     | “ANALOG DATA SDN BHD” matches image               |
| **registrationNumber**                | ✔️     | “190933432134” correct                            |
| **oldRegistrationNumber**             | ✔️     | “1234567-H” correct                               |
| **type**                              | ✔️     | Sdn. Bhd. (Private Limited)                       |
| **issuePlace**                        | ✔️     | “KL” appears correctly                            |
| **issueDate**                         | ✔️     | Correctly parsed to ISO: “2007-06-07”             |
| **confidence**                        | ✔️     | 0.8899 is reasonable for this type of certificate |

These fields need no further adjustment.

***

# ❌ **2. What Is Incorrect or Missing**

## **❌ A) `registrationDate` is empty**

But the certificate clearly states:

> “on and from the 7th day of June 2007, incorporated under…”

This means the **registration date is also 07 June 2007**.

### ✔️ Correct value should be:

    registrationDate: "2007-06-07"

### 🔧 How to fix:

Regex example:

```regex
on and from the\s+(\d{1,2})(?:st|nd|rd|th)?\s+day of\s+([A-Za-z]+)\s+(\d{4})
```

***

## **❌ B) `validUntil` is empty — but for Form 9 this should be null or omitted**

Form 9 *does not have an expiry date*.  
Your parser is correct to leave it blank, but **you should explicitly set**:

    validUntil: null

or remove it entirely.

Better to enforce consistency across all document types.

***

## **❌ C) `registeredAddress` is empty**

This is actually **correct**, because Form 9 certificates **do not contain a registered office address**.

Instead, the registered address appears in **Form 44 / Section 46 Notices**, not Form 9.

So you can safely treat this field as:

    registeredAddress: null

or simply exclude it.

***

## **❌ D) `signingOfficer` contains noise**

Current extracted value:

    "SSN.) 8 Svea DATUK NOR AZIMAH ABDUL AZIZ"

Image shows:

**DATUK NOR AZIMAH ABDUL AZIZ  
REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES  
MALAYSIA**

The OCR noise ("SSN.) 8 Svea") came from the signature area.

### ✔️ Correct value:

    signingOfficer: "DATUK NOR AZIMAH ABDUL AZIZ"

### 🔧 Fix using regex:

```python
officer = re.search(r"(DATUK\s+NOR\s+AZIMAH\s+ABDUL\s+AZIZ)", text)
```

This will cut out all surrounding garbage.

***

# ❌ **3. Missing QR Code Payload**

Field:

    "qrPayload": ""

But the Form 9 contains a QR code with an encoded payload (e.g., certificate info, tracking code).

### 🔧 Fix:

Use pyzbar or ZXing:

```python
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode
qr = decode(image)
if qr:
    qrPayload = qr[0].data.decode("utf-8")
```

***

# 📌 **4. Summary of What You Should Update in Your Detection Pipeline**

### ✅ Keep existing logic for:

*   docType
*   companyName
*   reg numbers
*   legalBasis
*   signing officer (after cleaning)
*   issue dates
*   type

### ❗ Must Update:

1.  **Extract registrationDate from "on and from the 7th day of June 2007"**
2.  **Strip noise from signingOfficer**
3.  **Set validUntil = null for Form 9**
4.  **registeredAddress = null (Form 9 does not contain this)**
5.  **Decode and populate qrPayload**

These five fixes will give you near‑perfect accuracy for Form 9 certificates.

# 🔥 If you want me to produce:

✔️ **Corrected final JSON for this certificate**  
✔️ **Regex + code for each field**  
✔️ **A universal SSM document extraction template (Form D, Form 9, Section 17, Section 14, Form 49, etc.)**

just tell me:

**“Dato’, generate corrected JSON”**  
or  
**“Dato’, give me the parsing code”**

I’m ready when you are.
